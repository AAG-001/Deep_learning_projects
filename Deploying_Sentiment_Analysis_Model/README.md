Project Overview
Welcome to the SageMaker deployment project! 
In this project we will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. 
We will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, we will deploy your model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.

Project Instructions
The deployment project which we will be working on is intended to be done using Amazon's SageMaker platform. In particular, it is assumed that we have a working notebook instance in which we can clone the deployment repository.
